# typing-monkey

The infinite monkey theorem states that if a monkey hits keys randomly on a typewriter for an endless amount of time, he will eventually type out any given text. This includes full William Shakespeare plays, rap songs, and newspaper articles. Anything written can and eventually will be typed out by the monkey.
Enjoy this take on the infinite monkey theorem. Instruct the monkey on how long to type and see what words he comes up with!
