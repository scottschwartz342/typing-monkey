        <h2>Infinite Monkey Theorem</h2>
        <p>
          The infinite monkey theorem states that if a monkey hits keys randomly
          on a typewriter for an endless amount of time, he will eventually type
          out any given text. This includes full William Shakespeare plays, rap
          songs, and newspaper articles. Anything written can and eventually
          will be typed out by the monkey. I suggest visiting its Wikipedia page
          to read about this theorem more in-depth. There, they go into the
          proofs and math behind it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          This theorem intrigued me when I first heard of it, mostly because of
          the name. I also like how it puts the idea of infinity into
          perspective. Although other websites already exist based upon this
          theorem, I still thought it would be an amusing personal project. This
          website was not based on any of those other websites. This is my take
          on the infinite monkey theorem.

        <h2>Behind the Scenes (About the Code)</h2>
        <p>
          This webpage was written with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It uses the
          “Holy Grail” layout via a CSS grid. I am still working on my style,
          but I am pleased with how this webpage turned out.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was some trial and error on the backend. The “monkey that is
          typing” is a method that randomly picks a character from “a - z”. That
          character is then added to a temporary working string. There are four
          outcomes once that new character is added to the word. The word is
          either a prefix and a word, prefix and not a word, not a prefix and a
          word, not a prefix or word. These conditions are checked whenever a
          character is added.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, I went with an API-based solution to get more experience
          with them. Unfortunately, waiting for the API hindered the program's
          speed, leading to little words being “typed”. I changed course with a
          local dictionary implemented as a de la Briandais Trie (DLB). This DLB
          is stored in a JSON file within the webpage. This greatly increased
          the speed of our “monkey”.
